Values in the headers of files under `displacement/`, `curvature/` are given as:
reduced elastic number,
floe length (sigma tilde),
wave amplitude (L),
wavenumber underneath the floe (k),
wave amplitude attenuation number (alpha),
wave phase at the floe left edge (phi).
The file `energy_mono.ssv` has, in column order, these same variables, followed
by the integrated squared curvature (not including any prefactor).
