Values in the headers of files under `displacement/`, `curvature/` are given as:
reduced elastic number,
floe length (sigma tilde),
wave amplitude (L),
wavenumber underneath the floe (k),
wave amplitude attenuation number (alpha),
wave phase at the floe left edge (phi).
The file `energy_mono.ssv` has, in column order, these same variables, followed
by the integrated squared curvature (not including any prefactor).

The content of the files fracture/binary_*.ssv are identified with headers. The
first 11 columns allow for building a WaveUnderFloes object, on which
FractureHandler objects can be applied. The 12th column give the result (single
abscissa) of such fracture searches. The archive
fracture/multi_strain_fracture.npz has a file params, whith 11 columns,
identical in order to the first 11 columns aforementioned. All the other files
are identified with a number corresponding to the row, in params, that allow
for building the WaveUnderFloes object on which the multi fracture handler is
applied.
